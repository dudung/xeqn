+ `23-oct-2022` Move from [eqnphys](https://github.com/dudung/eqnphys) to [xeqn](https://github.com/dudung/xeqn), since [the last has not yet given any search result](https://www.google.com/search?q=%2Bxeqn). Create folder structure as dist, draft, note, and src.
+ `22-oct-2022` Able make gravitational acceleration with down arrow using Mermaid inspired by [Paulo](https://stackoverflow.com/a/71545886/9475509). Make new folder named text, entries are labeled with four digits number, start from 0000.
+ `18-oct-2022` Try without deeply understand the [light and dark scheme](https://stackoverflow.com/a/62069503/9475509), but not work for markdown at GitHub, move to draw [3S for nuclear lecture](https://www.nrc.gov/docs/ML1318/ML13189A008.pdf). Find some reading materials [1](https://slideplayer.com/slide/14690066/), [2](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268013443_IAEA-CN-18464_Investigating_3S_Synergies_to_Support_Infrastructure_Development_and_Risk-Informed_Methodologies_for_3S_by_Design/figures?lo=1), [3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcpQ0eDlSOo&t=2358s), [4](https://www.nrc.gov/docs/ML1318/ML13189A008.pdf), [5](https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1104765), and [6](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/323459697_Integrated_Risk_Assessment_of_Safety_Security_and_Safeguards/figures).
+ `17-oct-2022` Start this project, read in a glance [Awesome Physics](https://github.com/wbierbower/awesome-physics), [Open Source Physics](https://github.com/OpenSourcePhysics), [GitHub public repositories in physics topic](https://github.com/topics/physics), [Wikipedia's lists of physics equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_physics_equations), and [and Advanced Placement Physics 2 Equations](https://secure-media.collegeboard.org/digitalServices/pdf/ap/ap-physics-2-equations-table.pdf), think not too much and just do it to realease the headache.
